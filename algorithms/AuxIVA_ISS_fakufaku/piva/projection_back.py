def project_back(Y, ref):
    """
    This function computes the frequency-domain filter that minimizes
    the squared error to a reference signal. This is commonly used
    to solve the scale ambiguity in BSS.

    Derivation of the projection
    ----------------------------

    The optimal filter `z` minimizes the squared error.

    .. math::

        \min E[|z^* y - x|^2]

    It should thus satsify the orthogonality condition
    and can be derived as follows

    .. math::

        0 & = E[y^*\\, (z^* y - x)]

        0 & = z^*\\, E[|y|^2] - E[y^* x]

        z^* & = \\frac{E[y^* x]}{E[|y|^2]}

        z & = \\frac{E[y x^*]}{E[|y|^2]}

    In practice, the expectations are replaced by the sample
    mean.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Y: array_like (n_frames, n_bins, n_channels)
        The STFT data to project back on the reference signal
    ref: array_like (n_frames, n_bins)
        The reference signal
    """

    num = np.sum(np.conj(ref[:, :, None]) * Y, axis=0)
    denom = np.sum(np.abs(Y) ** 2, axis=0)
    c = num / np.maximum(1e-15, denom)

    return np.conj(c[None, :, :]) * Y
